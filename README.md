Problem Statement

The main goal of this project is to create an application for organizing all the college events except those which are scheduled during SHRUTHI and SUDHEE. This application leads to the handling and formation of events and their scheduling. This application provides information regarding the events that are being
conducted in college at one place.

The project provides an easy process of communication to schedule and coordinate events by using an internet based application. The registered clubs can post their new events and schedules. The end users, that is the students can easily see the list of all the events and can register through the registration forms for the upcoming events provided by giving some credentials required.
